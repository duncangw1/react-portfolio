    "bio":"I'm Gene Duncan, a Full Stack Developer. I am currently attending the Coding Bootcamp through UNC Chapel Hill. I hope to use these skills to launch a new career in Software/Web Development. My ideal job would involve remote work with flexible office work available. Immediately after this course I plan to pursue freelance opportunities until I am able to land a full-time Developer job. The main goal of freelancing will be to reinforce my coding skills. I expect to also learn new coding languages and gain real-world experience along the way. A few years down the line I hope to be progressing in the field and, eventually, I would like to launch my own startup building useful applications for both business and entertainment purposes.",
